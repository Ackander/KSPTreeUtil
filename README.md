KSPTreeUtil
===========

This project was borne out of the need to have a more manageable way to manipulate tree.cfg files in Kerbal Space Program, initially for the project by Ackander ([Ackander's Vertical Tech Tree](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60469-TechTree-0-23-Ackander-s-Vertical-Tech-Tree-Release-v1-15-45-c-Jan-11-2014)).

I also needed to learn how C# works so this is also a learning exercise for me!

##Outline of what I want to achieve

- <del>open tree.cfg</del>
- create new tree.cfg
- save tree.cfg
- <del>scan gamedata directory</del>
- allow edits of existing tree data
- keep a running record of whether a part has been used in the current tree
